Let's review the exciting gameplay of this game:<br>
Skillfully connect numbers in a straight line that are the same or add up to ten, and they will magically disappear.<br>
Your move times will be displayed at the bottom of the game interface, and whenever they reach zero, a new row of numbers will appear on the screen.<br>
If no eliminable numbers can be found on the entire game interface, a new row of numbers will be added to the game.<br>

When the numbers touch the top of the screen, it means your game journey comes to an end.<br>
Don't forget to use those magical props when you're in trouble; they will give you a helping hand.<br>
Every time you successfully eliminate a row of numbers, your score will increase. After the game ends, these scores can be converted into gold coins, storing energy for your future challenges.<br>
