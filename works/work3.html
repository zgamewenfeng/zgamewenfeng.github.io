    <p class="intro">
      Welcome to the magical world of "monster square". <br>
      In this dreamlike realm crafted from pixels, a group of adorable little monsters are trapped inside blocks and desperately need your help to regain their freedom. <br>
      As a brave adventurer, you will use your wisdom and strategy to rescue these little creatures and return them to their homes.<br>
Game Features:<br>
* Retro Pixel Style: The game adopts a classic large-pixel style, taking you back to those nostalgic days of pixelated gameplay.<br>
* Rescue Trapped Monsters: Your mission is to rescue the little monsters trapped in various levels. Each level has monsters waiting to be freed. By merging blocks, you can unlock these monsters, and seeing them regain their freedom will fill you with a sense of accomplishment and joy, making you even more eager to challenge the next level.<br>
* Number Merging Mechanism: The core gameplay revolves around merging and upgrading numbers. You need to click on adjacent and identical blocks to merge them into larger-level blocks. This merging mechanism from small to large not only tests your observation skills but also your strategic planning abilities. Within a limited number of clicks, you need to constantly think about how to optimally utilize each click to maximize the merging effect, which will be your greatest challenge.<br>
* Limited Clicks and Block Rising Mechanism: Each level has a set number of clicks, requiring you to merge blocks as efficiently as possible within the limited operations. Meanwhile, every four clicks, the blocks rise up one row. If the blocks rise to a certain height, the game will end in failure. This mechanism adds tension and challenge to the game, forcing you to constantly think about how to optimally use each click to avoid failure.<br>
* Various Tools to Help You: Different tools can help you solve difficult problems and complete level tasks when you are in a dilemma.<br>
* Rich and Diverse Level Design: The game includes dozens of carefully designed levels, each with unique layouts and challenges. From simple merging tasks to complex block layouts, to the introduction of various game elements, you will constantly encounter new surprises and tests. These levels not only challenge your wisdom and strategy but also make your gameplay experience full of variety and fun. Whether you are a casual player or a challenge enthusiast, you can find your own fun in the game.<br>
Gameplay Instructions:<br>
* At the start of the game, you will see a level interface composed of various blocks, containing trapped little monsters.<br>
* Click on adjacent and identical blocks to merge them into larger-level blocks. Each merge will unlock the corresponding monster.<br>
* Pay attention to the rising position of the blocks and ensure you complete the level before they reach the top. If the blocks rise to a certain height without completing the level, the game will end in failure.<br>
* Use the limited number of clicks to reasonably plan each click to maximize the merging effect. You can try to merge more blocks to unlock more monsters.<br>
* Make wise use of tools to complete level tasks.<br>
